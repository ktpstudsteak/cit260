1.   What things went well for you this week?
	I breezed through 4.2. I was able to focus on the style and organization rather 
	than just making it work.

2.   What was challenging for you this week?
	I had a hard time understanding the logic behind 4.1. I'm still not sure how to apply
	what we were taught, but I did manage to find a solution that worked.

3    How can you overcome these challenges?
	Study harder and play with the code more.

	I can also do more of the examples in the slides.

4.   What was most engaging for you this week?
	Overcoming the challenges I had in 4.1. 

	Understanding how arrays in lists work in java
	rather than in python was a good expirience.
